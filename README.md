### Description
This weather website allows you to enter a city name and then see the temperature of that city. 

## Setup/Installation Requirements

You can open it locally within your computer by cloning the repository https://github.com/svealinnea/Weather-Tracker.git 
Here are some instructions on how to do so:

1. You will need an internet browser & a code editor installed on your computer. Examples include: VSCode.
2. When you open the link above you will need to click on the "clone or download button"
3. After it downloads you will need to open the document labeled “index.html"
4. You will then need to clone it on your computer git Clone 
5. After you clone it you will need to open it in your preferred code editor
6. You will then want to run the comman npm install followed but npm run build followed by npm run start
6. It will then open the project in the browser! I recommend using Chrome.

You will need to also create an API Key in order for this application to work. We used the API key found on https://openweathermap.org/ after we created an account. Once you create an account you can access your API key under API Keys. After you get your API key you can either paste the API key directly in to the code in main.js OR you will want to create a .env file.

How to create a .env file
1. In terminal within the cloned repository enter touch .env (this will create the .env file within the project)
2. You will then want to open the .env folder within the code editor. 
3. You will add .env to your gitignore folder
4. In the .env file you will add "process.env.API_KEY" and API_KEY="Your API key"
5. Then run npm install dotenv-webpack --save-dev
6. And add the plugin for dotenv webpack
